A traditional model of the smart helmet has been produced to assist miners operating in the mining industry. 
Many risky incidents commonly occur in the mining sector, many of which result in life threatening injuries or death. 
IoT has been recently expanded across different applications which brought a huge attention to the implementation of this project for the mining field, where a noisy
industrial environment can take place in. The main objective of this project is to design and develop a smart helmet for mining industry application. 
The system will provide Realtime monitoring of the hazardous events such as increase in temperature and humidity, release of gasses 
like Methane and Carbon Monoxide, conscious and unconscious state of the miner, removal of helmet of theminer and obstacle damage to the helmet. 
The programming and troubleshooting will be conducted on mainly two sections, helmet section and control room section that means the system will have
a transmitter to transmit necessary data to the control room or nearest manager and a receiver that
can be used by the control room or the managers to grab the data and alerts from the transmitter.
On the other side the system also syncs the data to the Webserver. The above systems include the
use of several sensors like IR sensor, Proximity sensor, Humidity Sensor, Gas sensor, and several
other modules and microprocessors like node MCU. On the major side it will take an attempt to
keep Realtime data over the cloud to the database along with email alert.
